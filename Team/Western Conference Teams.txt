Golden State Warriors: The Golden State Warriors, as the name implies, are the team of the Bay Area in Northern California. They currently hold the league’s record in best regular season after going 73-9 during a season, as well as the most wins in a season with 88 wins (including regular and post season). This team also features superstars Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, more commonly known as the splash brothers.

San Antonio Spurs: The San Antonio Spurs are based out of San Antonio, Texas. They are arguably one of the most underrated teams in the NBA, always not appreciated but always in the playoffs and appearing in the Western Conference Finals. With the trio of Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginobili, the team was very scary, and with the help of a few key players, were able to make it to the finals several years over the past decade, scoring a couple championships in the process. Although not having many big name players, the way the team integrates under Poppovich has always been a mesmerizing sight for the remaining 29 NBA teams. With LaMarcus Aldridge and Kawhi Leonard going strong, it will be interesting to see where the team fares in the upcoming years in the increasingly competitive Western Conference.
