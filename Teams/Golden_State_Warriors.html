	<p>The Golden State Warriors, as the name implies, are the team of the Bay Area in Northern California. They currently hold the league's record in best regular season after going 73-9 during a season, as well as the most wins in a season with 88 wins (including regular and post season). This team also features superstars Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, more commonly known as the splash brothers. However, with the recent coming of Kevin Durant with the ideology of "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em", the team has a lot riding on this season to go all the way and bring the championship home.</p>
