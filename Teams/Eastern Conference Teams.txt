Chicago Bulls: Known for the golden days of the 1990s, this team had threepeats (TWICE!) under the leadership of none other than the great Michael Jordan. This team also held the record for the most wins in a regular season of 72 games until overcome by the Golden State Warriors, who set the new record of 73 wins as it stands today.

They’ve had their fair share of superstars, with Larry Bird, Bill Russell, and more recently the rein of Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Ray Allen. The Lakers-Celtics rivalry was one for the ages, as they met a record 12 times in the finals. The Celtics, similar to their old time rivals, are currently in the rebuilding process after letting go of the big three a couple years ago. Founded: 1946Conference: EasternArena: TD GardenHead Coach: Brad StevensLocation: Boston, MADivision: Atlantic NBA Championships: 2008, 1986, 1984, 1981, 1976, 1974, 1969, 1968, 1966, 1965, 1964, 1963, 1962, 1961, 1960, 1959, 1957




Cleveland Cavaliers: The Cavaliers, the team that drafted Lebron James, and where he stayed for a few years until the thirst of a championship led him to forming a super team in South Beach. After having a successful stint in South Beach, Lebron decided to “come home”, just as Kyrie Irving was shaping to be one of the best point guards in the league, and the Cavs had just drafted Andrew Wiggins with the number one overall pick. After once again recruiting superstars such as Kevin Love, and adding depth through JR Smith and Iman Shumpert, Lebron was able to win a championship in 2016. They set a record of coming back from a 3-1 deficit in the finals to win the champion, something that had not been done before.
