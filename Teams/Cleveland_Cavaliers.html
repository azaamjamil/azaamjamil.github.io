	<p>The Cavaliers, the team that drafted <a href = "../Players/Lebron_James.html">Lebron James</a>, and where he stayed for a few years until the thirst of a championship led him to forming a super team in South Beach. After having a successful stint in South Beach, <a href = "../Players/Lebron_James.html">Lebron</a> decided to come home, just as <a href=“../Players/Kyrie_Irving.html”>Kyrie Irving</a> was shaping to be one of the best point guards in the league, and the Cavs had just drafted Andrew Wiggins with the number one overall pick. After once again recruiting superstars such as <a href=“../Players/Kevin_Love.html”>Kevin Love</a>, and adding depth through JR Smith and Iman Shumpert, <a href = "../Players/Lebron_James.html">Lebron</a> was able to win a championship in 2016. They set a record of coming back from a 3-1 deficit in the finals to win the champion, something that had not been done before.</p>
