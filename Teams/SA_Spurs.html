	<p>The San Antonio Spurs are based out of San Antonio, Texas. They are arguably one of the most underrated teams in the NBA, always not appreciated but always in the playoffs and appearing in the Western Conference Finals. With the trio of Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginobili, the team was very scary, and with the help of a few key players, were able to make it to the finals several years over the past decade, scoring a couple championships in the process. Although not having many big name players, the way the team integrates under <a href = "../Coaches/Gregg_Popovich.html">Poppovich</a> has always been a mesmerizing sight for the remaining 29 NBA teams. With <a href=“../Players/LaMarcus_Aldridge.html">LaMarcus Aldridge</a> and <a href = “../Players/Kawhi_Leonard.html">Kawhi Leonard</a> going strong, and under the experience provided by <a href = “../Players/Pau_Gasol.html">Pau Gasol</a>, it will be interesting to see where the team fares in the upcoming years in the increasingly competitive Western Conference.</p>
