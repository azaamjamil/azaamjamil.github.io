	<br><br>

	<p>Known for the golden days of the 1990s, this team had threepeats (TWICE!) under the leadership of none other than the great Michael Jordan. This team also held the record for the most wins in a regular season of 72 games until overcome by the Golden State Warriors, who set the new record of 73 wins as it stands today. They stand to be the fourth most valuable franchise in the NBA currently, with a value of about $2.3 billion. They are also the only NBA team to not lose a Finals; if they made it, they brought the ring home.</p>
