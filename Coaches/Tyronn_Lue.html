	<br /><br>
	<p>Tyronn Lue joined the <a href = "../Teams/Cleveland_Cavaliers.html">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> as head coach in 2016 after David Blatt was fired. Lue then won his first NBA Championship as head coach when he led <a href = "../Players/Lebron_James.html">Lebron James</a>, <a href = "../Players/Kevin_Love.html">Kevin Love</a>, and <a href = "../Players/Kyrie_Irving.html">Kyrie Irving</a> to the Cavaliers's first championship.</p>

	<p>Interesting fact: Played in the NBA from 1998-2009, including a stint with the <a href = "../Teams/LA_Lakers.html"> Los Angeles Lakers </a> where he won two championships. He is also the one who was infamously stepped over, after being obliterated by one of the sickest moves by none other than Allen Iverson himself. </p>
