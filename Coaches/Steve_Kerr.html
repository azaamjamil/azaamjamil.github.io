	<p>Joined Joined the <a href = "../Teams/Golden_State_Warriors.html">Golden State Warriors</a> as head coach in 2015. In his rookie year, he led <a href = "../Players/Klay_Thompson.html">Klay Thompson</a> and <a href = "../Players/Stephen_Curry.html">Stephen Curry</a> to their first championship. During the 2016 off-season, the Warriors acquired <a href = "../Players/Kevin_Durant.html">Kevin Durant</a>, which created an even stronger team.</p>
	
	<p>Interesting fact: Kerr was the first rookie coach to ever win a championship as the <a href = "../Teams/Golden_State_Warriors.html">Golden State Warriors</a> went in 2015. It was also under Kerr that the team set the record for most wins in a regular season.  </p>
